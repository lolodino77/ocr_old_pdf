Metaphysical Disputes, if not managed with the utmost Candour and Fairness, will prevail but little, either in settling the Question between the Persons concerned, or clearing it to the rest of the World. They who have no other End in their Inquiries, than to find out Truth and Right, can have no Reason to depart from a fair Treatment of each other; knowing how weak it is to turn the Arguments they would censure into Ridicule, or to treat Persons with Contempt undeservedly; and that such Treatment is as unworthy any Man of Learning and Judgment, as it ought to be beneath the Person so treated to make any Return of it. Mr. Law having published a second Edition of his Translation of Archbishop King’s Origin of Evil, and having annexed a Postscript in Answer to the three first Parts of My Defence of Dr. Clarke, I shall here endeavour to make the whole Matter as clear, and give him as plain an Answer, as I can.

1. First then, I asserted that Space was either Something real, distinct from Body or Matter; or else in the Instance there alleged, there would be no Difference between an Affirmative and a Negative. This Consequence, the Translator says, p. 1. is a very lame one; for the Reason why they (two bodies) do not touch, is because they are really distant: but is Distance therefore in the abstract any Thing real? We two differ, or there’s a Difference between us, but is Difference itself any Thing existing? etc. If Things were really distant from each other, the Distance between them is certainly Something real, viz. a certain Length of Space. When He explains this by saying, we two differ, or there’s a Difference between us — is Difference between us and Distance the same Thing? When we speak of Difference between two Things, we mean that there is something in the one which is not in the other: and the Particle between does not betoken in this case Distance or Length of Space, but only the Consideration of that which is in the one and which is not in the other, be it what it will. When I asserted Distance or Length of Space to be really something, I did not mean that it was a Substance; but must it therefore be absolutely nothing? are Properties, Relations, etc. mere Nothings? If they are, we shall find presently that Substances are nothing too, since they are only so many constituent Nothings (Properties) taken together. (See p. 13, 14, in the Postscript.) But if Properties are mere Nothings, how come we to talk of different Properties, and different Relations, and the several Degrees of them? According to this way of Reasoning, they are only different Degrees and different Relations of Nothing, that is, no Degrees, nor no Relations at all. And so when we talk of the Difference of Substances, we mean only that one Substance is made up of more or different kinds of Nothings. If there be no Ideata, nothing without us to answer the Ideas or Notions in our Minds, then we may put one Relation or one Property for another; and we may affirm in all Propriety of Speech, that two Bodies which are twice as far distant from each other as two other Bodies are, are yet equally distant, because Distance is Nothing, and there can be no Quantities no Differences of Nothing. This Distance that is between two Bodies, which do not touch, is a part of Space, and Space is something which penetrates and receives all Bodies: the Idea of which and of its actually Existence (though we suppose all created Beings away) we can by no means get rid of; and therefore since it necessarily will remain, and since it cannot exist separately of itself; it undeniably proves the Existence of some Substance, whose Property it is, and which constitutes its Existence.

2. In Answer to my showing the Difference between Whiteness and Space, he says, p. 2. that Whiteness is an abstract Idea which can have no Subsistence of itself, and so far it agrees with pure Extension, etc. If this be all he means by an abstract Idea (which is far from his Meaning in other Places,) I very readily grant pure Extension to be of the same Kind: But pure Extension is not Space but a Property of Space, as Whiteness is not Body, but a Property of Body. If you consider Space as nothing but a Property, it cannot subsist of itself, but must require some Substance as Whiteness does: Yet it does not follow, that it is the Property of Body only, which is what he seems to think through the whole Postscript.

3. What I said concerning the Difference between Darkness and Space, the Translator endeavours to evade the Force of, by saying, ibid. that he was so far from asserting Darkness to be a Capacity of receiving Light, that he only proposed it as a parallel piece of Nonsense with the former (with Space’s Capacity of receiving Body.) Whether he meant the one or the other must be judged.
